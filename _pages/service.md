I am among the initiator and organizer of the following workshops:

 <ul>
  <li>   <a href="http://easys-online.com/" target="_blank">European Accounting Symposium for Young Scholars (EASYS)</a>   
       <ul>  <li> The European Accounting Symposium for Young Scholars is an annual meeting that takes place right before the European Accounting Association Annual meeting. It is meant to establish research networks among young scholars. Due to the Covid pandemic, the workshop is <a href="http://easys-online.com/easys-online/" target="_blank">online</a> for the time being. </li> </ul> 
 <li> <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/events/erasmus-accounting-workshop" target="_blank">Erasmus Accounting Workshop</a>  
      <ul> <li> The first Erasmus Accounting Workshop will be held on Friday, 26 April 2021. This half-day event will feature the work of four researchers from top schools, and aims to foster and strengthen the network of scholars around the world. </li> </ul> 
 <li> <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/events/dutch-workshop-corporate-taxation" target="_blank">Dutch Workshop on Corporate Taxation</a>  
      <ul> <li> The Dutch Workshop on Corporate Taxation brings together researcher from accounting and economics at Dutch universities. This circle is defined widely: Anyone who has an interest in issues related to corporate taxation, whose current or past research touches upon corporate taxes or whose future research might include corporate taxation is highly welcome as a participant.   </li>  </ul>
