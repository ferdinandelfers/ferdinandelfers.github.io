I am an assistant professor of financial accounting at the [Erasmus School of Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-business-economics/accounting-auditing-and-control) at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am mostly interested in the regulation of financial institutions and the role of accounting for private firms.
